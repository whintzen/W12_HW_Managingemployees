# W12_HW_Managingemployees

In this homework assignment, I need to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. 

# How the Process Works
Open a terminal and type "node companydb.js", as this calls the application.  A drop down list will appear for you to select an option of what you would like to do.  You can select one of the list below.  Based on the selection you will need to either enter some information or make a select of choices from a drop dow list.  I have given a summary of what takes place as you select on of the below options 
   *  View all Employees - Employee and Role tables are Inner Joined by Role_id and ordered by the EEID         
   *  View all Employees by Manager - Employee and Role tables are Inner Joined by Role_id and ordered by the Manager
   *  View all Employees by Titles/Roles - Employee and Role tables are Inner Joined by Role_id and ordered by the
      title     
   *  View all Departments - Select All records from the Department table    
   *  View all Roles - Role and Department tables are Inner Joined by department_id and ordered by the Title        
   *  Add New Departments - A new department is INserted into the Department table    
   *  Add New Titles/Roles - A new Title/Role, along with the Salary and Department_Id is INserted into the Eerole table  
   *  Add New Employee - A new employee by First Name, Last Name, Role ID, Manager Name and Manager ID is added       
   *  Update Employee Manager - Select the Employee and using the UPDATE process assign a Manager.  The Manager can have
      the same Role Id as the employee or can be in a similar group as the employee.  For example, employee is a Sales Person and his Manager is a Sales Manager. 
   *  Remove Employee
   *  Remove Department and Titles/Roles

# User Story

## Instructions
Design the following database schema containing three tables:

# Tools:

   from the drop down list          
 * Package json
